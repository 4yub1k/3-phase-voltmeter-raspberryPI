Measure 3 Phase AC Voltages using Raspberry - Proteus Simulation

In last project we measured 3 phase AC voltage using Arduino. This time i decided to try it with Raspberry PI. During this project, found there was no proper Library/module for communication between Raspberry pi and LCD. So, I decided to write LCD library for it.

Feel free to use this project âœŒ.

In this project will will use Raspberry pi computer, with pi computers you need to use separate IC for analogue input. We have used MCP3008.
